## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to to create a place for my notes about the Pre-work for the Bootcamp that I can refer to. I want to explore programming with a real project so I can see my code working.
This project was built to use HTML, css, js and git in a simple and straightforward website.
It gives me a place to keep notes that I make during the Bootcamp. It will also be a way to show me how much I have learned by the end.
I learend that I still remember my HTML and CSS from when I used it last. It was a long time ago and I feel good that I remembered so much. Git and js are new to me and are a bit harder to get my head around. Git seems convoluted but I understand the need to keep track of multiple versions of the code as you work on it. The js leaves me confused as to how the code will be used to add value. I can't see the whole puzzle yet/

This Study Guide can be used by me when I need to refresh my knowledge of the basic code. It contains notes for how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. We also opened the DevTools consolewhere we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
